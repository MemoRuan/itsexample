::::: COMMIT :::::
in order to commit in Git, you will need to set a username and an email so that Git can tell who is making the commit.
In order to do so,

   Download and install Git
   Open command prompt in your repository where you want to make a commit and type
   git config --global user.email "type_your_email_here" and press Enter
   Then type git config --global user.name "type_your_name_here" and press Enter

Note: When typing the commands, you can omit "--global" if you don't want the email and username you are providing to be the default for every commit you may make later

Mapping Agile concepts into GitHub
https://www.zenhub.com/blog/how-to-use-github-agile-project-management/

Agile  >   Zenhub
Sprint → Milestone
User Stories → GitHub Issues
Epics → Epics
Product backlog → Open issues without a Milestone (Master Story List)
Sprint backlog → Issues with a Milestone
----- Use Icebox pipeline to “freeze” stories that aren’t a priority,
----- Use Backlog pipeline to prioritize issues for multiple Milestones
